# Airbnb Price Analysis – Austin, TX

## Overview
This project analyzes 10,500+ Airbnb listings from Austin, Texas to identify
key drivers of nightly rental prices using Python and multiple linear regression.

## Business Question
What listing and host characteristics most strongly influence nightly prices?

## Data
Source: Inside Airbnb (Austin, TX)
Records: 10,533 listings

## Tools
- Python (pandas, NumPy, statsmodels)
- SQL (exploratory analysis)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Steps
- Cleaned and validated raw pricing data
- Engineered features (log price, grouped neighborhoods)
- Built and evaluated a multiple linear regression model

## Results
- Adjusted R²: 0.35
- Key drivers: room type, location, minimum nights, availability

## Limitations

- Moderate performance on unseen data

## Files
- `notebooks/`: Full analysis
- `sql/`: Supporting queries
